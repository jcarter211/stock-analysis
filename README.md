# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project 
Steve recently graduated with a degree in finance. His parents are showing their support of his academics and education by becoming his first clients. they have a special interest in green enery. While Steve's parents wanted to invest all of their money into one company, Steve wanted to research a few more green energy stocks. In order to look at all of the stocks Steve has chosen, we used VBA to perform functions that give us a better understanding of each company. Steve can easily analyze the dataset with the use of the code in VBA. The code we originally built processed the 12 stocks Steve chose to further research; however, we realized that it would not be ideal if we wanted to analyze much larger sets of stock data. In order to make this code more friendly to large data sets, we refactored the code. 
## Results 
There are a few key results after refactoring the original code. The time to run the code to perform an analysis of both the 2017 and 2018 stocks was drastically reduced.

compare the performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
